# Personal Expense Tracker (CLI-Based)

A simple command-line tool to track personal expenses, manage a monthly budget, and persist data using CSV files. Built in Python, this project showcases core programming concepts like file I/O, data validation, user input handling, and object-oriented design.

## Features

- Add new expenses with date, category, amount, and description
- View all recorded expenses in a formatted table
- Set and track a monthly budget
- Persist expenses between sessions using CSV
- Input validation for dates and amounts

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Standard Library (`csv`, `datetime`, `os`)

## Purpose

This is a personal project designed to reinforce my skills in:
- Python programming and CLI tool design
- Error handling and user input validation
- File operations and persistent storage
- Object-oriented programming principles

I am sharing this project as part of my portfolio while seeking roles in **Software Engineering** and/or **AI/ML Engineering**.
